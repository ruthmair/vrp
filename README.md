- Models for different VRP variants
- Random instance creation based on Euclidian costs, demand ranges, time window ranges, etc.

## Capacitated VRP: cvrp.ipynb

- big-M model
- flow model
- multi-commodity flow model
- discretized model
- optional rounded capacity cuts for sets of size 2 and 3

## VRP with time windows: vrptw.ipynb

- big-M model
- flow model
